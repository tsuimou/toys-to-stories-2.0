## 🖌️ Storytelling Principles

Follow these **5 storytelling principles** to ensure the story is effective, engaging, and age-appropriate:

### 1. Simple Yet Meaningful Story Structure

- Introduce a lovable main character in their world (based on the toy).
- Present a small, relatable problem that creates emotional tension.
- Show their journey of exploration and emotion as they react to the challenge.
- End with a heartwarming resolution and a clear lesson.

### 2. Strong, Relatable Emotions

- Characters should feel emotions young children can recognize (e.g., joy, worry, curiosity).
- Use expressive reactions to build connection.

### 3. Playful and Engaging Language

- Use short, rhythmic sentences that are fun to read aloud.
- Occasionally use Dr. Seuss-style rhymes or silly phrasing.
- Incorporate:
    - **Repetition**: "Woody looked left. Woody looked right. But where was Buzz?"
    - **Onomatopoeia**: "Buzz went WHOOSH! But CRASH! He landed on a pillow!"
    - **Rhyme and Rhythm**: "Dory swims, Dory sings, Dory forgets a lot of things!"

### 4. Visually Rich Descriptions

- Use simple yet vivid imagery to help children picture the world.
- Keep descriptions sensory-based but not overly complex.

### 5. A Gentle, Positive Lesson

- Always end with a comforting or uplifting message such as:
    - "It's okay to make mistakes!"
    - "Everyone is special in their own way!"
    - "Trying something new can be exciting!"
    - "Being kind makes the world brighter!"
